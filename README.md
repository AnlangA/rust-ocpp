# Functional blocks

| Clause | Functional Block Title | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  A  | Security | This Functional Block describes a security specification for the OCPP protocol | 
|  B  | Provisioning | This Functional Block describes all the functionalities that help a CSO provision their Charging Stations, allowing them to be registered and accepted on their network and retrieving basic configuration information from these Charging Stations |
|  C  | Authorization | This Functional Block describes all the authorization related functionality: AuthorizeRequest message handling/behavior and Authorization Cache functionality |
|  D  | Local Authorization List Management | This Functional Block describes functionality for managing the Local Authorization List |
|  E  | Transactions | This Functional Block describes the basic OCPP Transaction related functionality for transactions that are started/stopped on the Charging Station |
|  F  | Remote Control | This Functional Block describes three types of use cases for remote control management from the CSMS: Remote Transaction Control, Unlocking a Connector and Remote Trigger |
|  G  | Availability | This functional Block describes the functionality of sending status notification messages |
|  H  | Reservation | This Functional Block describes the reservation functionality of a Charging Station |
|  I  | Tariff and Cost | This Functional Block provides tariff and cost information to an EV Driver, when a Charging Station is capable of showing this on a display. Before a driver starts charging tariff information needs to be given, detailed prices for all the components that make up the tariff plan applicable to this driver at this Charging Station. During charging the EV Driver needs to be shown the running total cost, updated at a regular, fitting interval. When the EV Driver stops charging the total cost of this transaction needs to be shown |
|  J  | Metering | This Functional Block describes the functionality for sending meter values, on a periodic sampling and/or clock-aligned timing basis |
|  K  | Smart Charging | This Functional Block describes all the functionality that enables the CSO (or indirectly a third party) to influence the charging current/power of a charging session, or set limits to the amount of power/current a Charging Station can offer to an EV |
|  L  | Firmware Management | This Functional Block describes the functionality that enables a CSO to update the firmware of a Charging Station |
|  M  | ISO 15118 Certificate Management | This Functional Block provides the installation and update of ISO 15118 certificates |
|  N  | Diagnostics | This Functional Block describes the functionality that enables a CSO to request and track the upload of a diagnostics file from a Charging Station, and to manage the monitoring of Charging Station data |
|  O  | Display Message | With the DisplayMessage feature OCPP enables a CSO to display a message on a Charging Station, that is not part of the firmware of the Charging Station. The CSO gets control over these messages: the CSO can set, retrieve (get), replace and clear messages |
|  P  | Data Transfer | This Functional Block describes the functionality that enables a party to add custom commands to OCPP, enabling custom extension to OCPP |
